9. Troubleshooting. 

###### I Guess I am a sheep, but its fine, I think I'd rather know I'm a sheep then live in denial as a "wolf". Also I'm getting pretty fast at working in neovim. - This is not really a major skill by my self esteem like it. 
###### There's nothing wrong with being Preston, You got this bro!
