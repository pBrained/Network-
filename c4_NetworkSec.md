## Explain the importance of network security

Logical security

Encryption

- Data in transit
- Data at rest
Certificates

- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Self-signed

Identity and access management (IAM)
- Authentication
- - Multifactor authentication (MFA)
- - Single sign-on (SSO)
- - Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
- - LDAP
- -  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
- -  Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
- -  Time-based authentication
- Authorization
- - Least privilege
- - Role-based access control
- Geofencing

Physical security
- Camera
- Locks
Deception technologies
- Honeypot
- Honeynet
Common security terminology

- Risk
- Vulnerability
- Exploit
- Threat
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad Audits and regulatory compliance
- Data locality
- Payment Card Industry Data

Security Standards (PCI DSS)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Network segmentation enforcement
- Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
- Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), industrial control System (ICS), operational technology (OT)
- Guest
- Bring your own device (BYOD)

## Summarize various types of attacks and their impact to the network.
- Denial-of-service (DoS)/ distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
- VLAN hopping
- Media Access Control (MAC) flooding
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning
- ARP spoofing
- DNS poisoning
- DNS spoofing
- Rogue devices and services
- - DHCP
- - AP
- Evil twin
- On-path attack
- Social engineering
- - Phishing
- - Dumpster diving
- - Shoulder surfing
- - Tailgating
- Malware

## Given a scenario, apply network security features, defense techniques, and solutions. 

Device Hardening
- Disable unused ports and services
- Change default passwords

Network Access Control (NAC)
- Port Security 
- 802.1X
- MAC filtering

Key Management

Security Rules
- Access control list (ACL)
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering
- Content filtering

Zones
- Trusted vs. untrusted
- Screened subnet
